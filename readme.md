Wiki-Chrome
---

A packaging of [wiki](https://github.com/fedwiki/wiki-node-server)'s express server as a chrome app. At this time it serves on port 3000 and accepts all edits (Persona has been removed for this exploration).

Installation
---
Until some final kinks are worked out and this gets published on the chrome app store, the built app is checked into the 'dist' branch on github. Clone the repo and go to chrome://extensions in chrome or chromium browser. Enable developer mode and click 'load unpacked extension.'

The server only runs while the app is active. but it will serve your wiki to anyone that asks. Try using ifconfig and giving someone on the same LAN your IP address :)

NOTE: if you don't get redirected to welcome-visitors, try manually adding it to the location bar.
